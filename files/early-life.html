    <h1>Early life and education</h1>
    <H2>Early life</H2>
    <p>Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of <br> Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat, <br> in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always remembered <br> the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):</p>
    <p>“My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the <br> neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with another pair of eyes; <br> the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful knowledge and learning <br> in the world which you cannot get unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden <br> ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path <br> through this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”</p>
    <p>Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to Serbian Orthodox school, and <br> later to German elementary school in Perlez. He enrolled in high school in Pančevo, <br> and later in the Real Gymnasium. He was one of the best students there; <br> a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give <br> Pupin a scholarship.</p>
    <p>Because of his activity in the “Serbian Youth” movement, which at that time had many <br> problems with Austro-Hungarian police authorities, Pupin had to leave Pančevo. <br> In 1872, he went to Prague, where he continued the sixth and first half of <br> the seventh year. After his father died in March 1874, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel <br> his education in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the United States.</p>
    <p>“When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. <br> Had I brought five hundred dollars, instead of five cents, my immediate career <br> in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would have been the same. <br> A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money <br> which he has brought with him. I brought five cents, and immediately spent it upon a  <br> piece of prune pie, which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. <br> It contained nothing but pits of prunes. If I had brought five hundred dollars, <br> it would have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things, <br> but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in each case. <br> It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a handicap to <br> any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has the <br> stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.”</p>
    <h2>Studies in America and Ph.D</h2>
    <p>For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a manual laborer (most notably <br> at the biscuit factory on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan) while he learned English, <br> Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. After three years of <br> various courses, in the autumn of 1879 he successfully finished his tests and entered Columbia <br> College, where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's <br> predicted that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, <br> and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student, <br> he was elected president of his class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors <br> in 1883 and became an American citizen at the same time.</p>
    <p>He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he <br> returned to Columbia University to become a lecturer of mathematical physics in the <br> newly formed Department of Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research <br> pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis.</p>
    <p>Pupin completed his studies in 1883 as one of the best students, especially in the field of <br> physics and mathematics, which gave him a diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, <br> initially the United Kingdom (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling <br> at the University of Cambridge. He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim <br> to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of <br> Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, <br> and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted  <br> this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the <br> passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images <br> on January 2, 1896. Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic <br> screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, <br> from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, <br> Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary X-rays. <br> With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. <br> He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. <br> A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image of his left hand prior <br> to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging <br> failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was "too weak and nervous to be stood <br> still nearly an hour" which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. <br> In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the  <br> patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, <br> which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure <br> of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if "drawn with pen and ink."  <br> Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.</p>
