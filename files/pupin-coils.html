    <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", <br> followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, <br> which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent <br> was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), <br> making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, <br> as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this <br> point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose <br> control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the <br> range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
